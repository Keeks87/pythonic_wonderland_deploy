                    <p> I am a highly motivated Software engineer who enjoys growing
                        my knowledge on topics such as AI and Software Engineering.
                        I am currently upskilling in Web Development, I am eager to
                        contribute my skills and dedication to the field of
                        technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am committed to achieving my goals and expanding my
                        knowledge base. I enjoy spending time outdoors and engaging
                        in physical activities, which allows me to maintain a
                        healthy work-life balance and stay focused on my goals. 
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        I also gained valuable experience as, a Coding Mentor by
                        Spearheading the refactoring of Django tasks within the
                        learning department. The successful completion of these
                        refactoring initiatives resulted in streamlined processes,
                        and enhanced code maintainability, contributing to an
                        improved learning experience for students.
